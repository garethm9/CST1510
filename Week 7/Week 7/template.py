# =================================================================== FUNCTIONS
# 1. Write parse_line(raw_line) that cleans and parses one raw, messy line
#    into a dict. Handle inconsistent spacing and case - that is the whole
#    point of this week.
#
#    Typical and above: also write status_of(...), shaped for your lane
#    (e.g. OVER LIMIT / WARNING / OK, or FLAGGED / OK). Give both a
#    one-line docstring.

def parse_line(raw_line):
    """function that parses a messy line step by step"""
    #stripping the whole line
    line = raw_line.strip()

    #splitting off hostname from the line
    hostname_part, rest = line.split(",", 1)

    #cleaning hostname with strip() and lower()
    hostname = hostname_part.strip().lower()

    #splitting rest and taking key and value
    data = {"hostname": hostname}

    for piece in rest.split(","):
        key, value = piece.split("=")
        data[key.strip()] = float(value.strip())

def status_of(used, total, warning_at=90):
    """returns overlimit, warning or okay based on percentage"""
    percent = (used/total) * 100
    if percent >= 100:
        return "OVER LIMIT"
    elif percent >= warning_at:
        return "WARNING"
    else:
        return "OK"



# ====================================================================== INPUT
# 2. Your raw, messy records - at least 5, deliberately varied in spacing
#    and case. Match the shape to your lane:
#
#    AI / Data Science : "  Survey_2026 , rating=4 , age=23  "
#    Cyber Security     : "SRC=10.0.0.5,ATTEMPTS=12,RESULT=FAILED"
#    IT                  : "  Srv-01 , used=87 , total=100  "
#
#    Excellent: save these lines to a file and load them with open() /
#    a for loop over the file, instead of writing them directly here.

raw_records = {"id":1123
               ,"name": gareth

               ,"grade":A
               ,"gender":M}

with open(student.txt) as f:
    for key, value in student.items:
        f.write(f"{key},{value}\n")



# =============================================================== PROCESS + OUTPUT
# 3. Parse and report on every record.
#
#    Threshold : parse each record, print the cleaned dict.
#    Typical   : also call status_of(...) for each, print it alongside.
#    Excellent : print a one-line summary at the end - how many records,
#                how many flagged.

for raw_record in raw_records:
    parse_line(raw_record)   




# ==========================================================================
# 4. Before you finish:
#
#    [ ] Run it against at least 5 genuinely messy raw records
#    [ ] Run it with a value that will not convert to a number - write the
#        error down
#    [ ] Check every function does one job, with a docstring
